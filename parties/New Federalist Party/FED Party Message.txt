The New Federalist Party is a Libertarian Centrist political party in the 4chan Assembly.
It was founded on 2 December 2018 by Publius and AnonLogic, resulting in the disbandment of the Modern Whig Party.
The New Federalist Party is predicated on two core principles:
1. The government should be as limited and decentralized as possible
2. That approach to government must be pragmatic, free of the rigid constraints of ideology and partisanship.
