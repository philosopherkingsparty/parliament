ASSEMBLY BILL 2 (A.B. 2 (2018))
Motion "LEET" Act: Let's Embrace Existing Technology Act
 
I. To replicate the Fandom wiki to Github (with the intention of migration).
 
II. Currently, we are hosting everything on 4chan-parliament.fandom.com. As we have seen from today’s raids, this site is susceptible to raiding, because it lacks in extensible privileges. Open source software packages used by millions are smoothly version controlled using Github to manage their complicated bodies of logic. If we can successfully govern ourselves through Github, we stand a chance at our body politic growing to the same scale. This could very well become a political organization that supersedes the borders of 4chan.org.
 
III. Benefits of moving to Github:
- Complete audit log of all edits to the body of law.
- Robust method of versioning with hierarchical permissions that can be tailored according to our Constitution. I.e., the “master branch” may contain the official record of everything.
- Unraidable, unless Github itself is infiltrated, or our offices are compromised.
- Meta comments can be made by all on any document.
- Pull requests can be used for proposing edits to the constitution or any body.
- Metrics on most productive Assembly members.
- Portable via downloading the whole repo as a single zip file.
- Project tracking widget and wiki widget built into a repo - allows for the Executive to better ensure that execution of ratified motions occurs.
